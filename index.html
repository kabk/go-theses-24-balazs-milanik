						In 2004, when I was around three, my parents finally decided that I was old enough for them to
						bring me along to the capital of Hungary, Budapest. Other than falling head-first into a
						fountain in the Buda castle, the most memorable moments of my visit came from the discovery of
						the metro, hidden below the city. I was amazed by this intricate, yet robust underground system
						and all its audio-visual aspects: the colourful and grandiose interiors of the stations, the
						smell of electricity, the sounds of announcements, the loud rumbling of the rolling stocks, or
						standing on seemingly never-ending escalators connecting these cut-off spaces with the surface
						above.

						Metros are an essential part of many modern cities. In the rush of the metropolis, our means of
						traveling present themselves as a necessity to attend to our everyday duties. As metros are one
						of the most feasible and reliable ways of transportation, and with many countries currently
						maintaining or building metro lines, they emerge as relevant focal points of modern metropolitan
						infrastructure. <br><br>
						Budapest opened the first of its current four metro lines in 1896, becoming continental Europe’s
						first subway, with line 3 built between 1970 and 1990 respectively.<br><br>
						Commonly referred to as the Kék Metró (Blue Metro) Line 3 runs from North to South on the Pest
						side of the city. Being the longest and busiest line in the Budapest public transport
						system, it serves as a vital connection between commercial, industrial, and residential areas,
						while also accessing several important public points such as hospitals, bus terminals, train
						stations, and other metro lines.

						When someone decides to take the metro in Budapest, they must find the entrance to the station,
						which in most cases is situated in an underpass. These underground networks were planned and
						built alongside the stations to provide spaces for the mass movements of the people.<br><br>
						While being inevitable sections of one’s journey, the underpasses often don’t even belong to
						the transit company that is in charge of the metro, meaning that unlike the system itself,
						they are freely accessible, never closed, and often left unsupervised.<br><br>
						Provided this restricted control, as well as, external financial reasons, the underpasses of
						Budapest were left out of the renovation in 2017. The old constructions of Line 3 still remain
						untouched, both in regards to the architecture and social landscape.
						In my personal exploration I have descended multiple of these underpasses, one of them being the
						largest underground system in the city: Nyugati Pályaudvar. (Western Railway Station)

						While the underpass of Nyugati Pályaudvar is a huge and busy environment, for many it is but a
						temporary location. As passing through it from the stairs to the entrance of the metro, it takes
						but a fraction of one’s travel. After all, it was designated to be a transitional zone, yet
						among the constant rush of this underground complex one can easily miss those who stand, sit, or
						lay still in this space.<br><br>
						For the less privileged individuals of society, an underpass such as Nyugati often means a

						There is no doubt at this point that these are the ticket inspectors of the company. I reach
						into my pockets and look for my ticket. A pack of cigarettes, keys, a lighter, ticket. I take it
						out. It’s folded in ways that would shame origami. Barely going into the ticket reader, I
						finally stamp it. I approach the personnel, and one of them silently swings his left hand toward
						the escalators. I pass them. They couldn’t care less about checking my ticket. Without saying a
						word I slide my ticket back into my pocket and step on the moving stairs under.

						Upon passing the inspectors of the metro, I couldn’t help but think of Nimród Antal’s debut
						film from 2003, Kontroll. Entirely filmed in the Budapest metro system of the time, the story
						presents a fictional tale of a group of ticket inspectors, whose daily routine mostly consists
						of checking for passengers' tickets and passes. In the world of the underground, they are the
						first line of defense, supervising people and deciding who is eligible to use their territory
						based on the regulations of the overseeing company.

						In Kontroll the metro acts as an environment of duality, despite its strictly controlled,
						technical stage, it is also a place inhabited by humans, meaning that just as much as the space
						in which the story takes place was designed to be supervised, the humans that are meant to
						supervise it, often are forced to obey rules of thumb, rather than the written laws issued by
						the overseeing company.<br><br>
						Albeit the movie often presents extremities for the average user of the metro in 2003,
						Kontroll’ s depicted situations felt familiar as the Budapest underground, especially before the
						renovation represented a difficult environment to navigate from the institutional point of view.

						the misuse of space to rampart corruption among the ticket inspectors. (Fahrsbucht.de -

					<p class="main">
						To supervise a claimed space and to establish a tangible and metaphysical hierarchy of rule,
						enforced using direct or non-direct force is an institutional need. Contemporary supervision and
						surveillance politics are often focused on controlling access, particularly to infrastructural
						spots, such as border crossings, airports, or in our case metros, where consequently humans
						become quantifiable data and the rules of the overseers are enforced in a faceless unknowable
						form. (Galič et al., 2016)<span class="reference-toggle">&nbsp;[22]</span><a

						Since some 20 years had passed after the filming of Kontroll, the job of the inspectors “had

						automatised via CCTV cameras and ticketing machines, the order of the stations is still
						relying on the often unforgiving jobs of ticket inspectors and perron guards. This means that
						the system, despite its renovation had inherited the same functions in terms of supervision,
						which has also brought along the frictions of it’s past state.

						</a> , about how easy it was to
						forge the newly introduced electronic ticket of the company. The video itself was rather a call
						to action towards the company to fix the issue, yet I found that many comments under the video
						have started to recall their own cases of getting through security with a various “replica” of
						passes.
						The passes (supposedly) included:
						<br><br>
						&mdash; an IKEA family card;<br>
						&mdash; a slice of cheese;<br>
						&mdash; a pub’s customer card;<br>
						&mdash; a pass from another region of the country;<br>
						&mdash; a label of a wine bottle;<br>
						&mdash; an entrance ticket to the Vesuvius;<br>
						&mdash; saying “hi”
						<br><br>
						To cut frictions as such loose, in the 2010s Budapest had tried to (re-)implement a system of
						gates, similar to the ones used in the Netherlands or on the Brussels metro, however, this was
						never achieved. Even though the gates have appeared on top of the escalators in some of the
						stations, they never become truly operational.
						<br><br>
						In most cases, they simply were removed thereafter, while in others it was the ticket
						inspector’s job to manually open and close them after the passengers had shown them their
						tickets. (Szalai, 2017)<span class="reference-toggle">&nbsp;[26]</span><a

						As the doors would work on a binary basis (one either can pass or not), and one could hardly
						argue with a soulless machine, by still heavily relying on human force, the system creates a
						large space for resistance, which from the perspective of the institution can mean another set
						of problems and a lesser degree of supervision. Yet on the other hand, such resistance and
						irritation can also uphold certain humanity under the Earth.

						Despite the fact that the previous sections tackled the lacking aspects of the renovation, such
						as the underpass and the conduct of oversight; once we arrive at the stations, we are welcomed
						by a completely changed environment, which some six years ago, was a vastly different landscape.
						<br><br>
						By realising ideas through the occupation of these spaces, designers oversee refining these
						environments to provide an optimal space for the institution that commissions them, just as much
						for the passenger that uses the metro.
						<br><br>
						As the original planning of the line ran on an arguably low budget, one wouldn’t find the
						same “underground cathedrals” that were thematically present in other countries of the Eastern
						Block. Instead, contemporary designers, architects, and urbanists had to implement
						cheaper and often more playful visual ideas to provide and imitate a pleasant environment for
						travel. The aim was to uphold both the aesthetic, as well as, the infrastructural needs of the
						system.
						<br><br>
						This led to a deeply interesting and aesthetically detailed attention to the space, categorised
						by the vivid choices behind the use of colours, materials, shapes, and textures, informed by the
						taste of the time trends of the 70s and 80s.

						</a> The trends of station design changed
						with time, and many of the old stations were not aging well, especially in the broader framework
						of a developing capital city. Therefore the designers were given a free hand regarding to what
						extent they can alter the interiors of these stations.
						<br><br>
						Since the line counts 20 stations in total, the extent of deviation from the original interiors
						varies by each space. The designers of the new environs, however, had overall rejected to
						maintain the visual traditions of the previous era. The overarching notions included more
						welcoming designs, presented in cleaner and brighter settings. .

						In Deák Ferenc tér we can still observe the remnants of this otherwise bygone visual era.
						Given the fact that it serves as the main transfer point between 3 of the city’s 4 lines (1,2,3)
						one can find a sharp and often contrasting blending of visual solutions since the station itself
						has been expanded several times in the past, and current centuries, without a complete
						standardisation effort ever taking place. Visiting the different points of the station, the
						passenger finds a maze of graphical and architectural disharmony consisting of alleyways,
						escalators, platforms, signs, and textures.

						ceiling display numbers, counting back every half a minute, signaling the trains assumed
						arrival.

						While the station interiors describe a visual narrative and act as important reference point of
						navigation, the average passenger can find themself spending most of their time on the metro,
						idly waiting to arrive to their destination. Given the rapid pace of the system in general and
						with 19 of the 20 stations of Line 3 running below the ground, one is provided with way fewer
						visual confirmations as compared to other above-the-ground means of transport.
						<br><br>
						Contrary to a bus or a tram, where with the movement of the vehicle one can see their
						environment changing as they enter different parts of the city, in the case of Line 3 we mostly
						see darkness with stations suddenly appearing or passing by.
						<br><br>
						Therefore, the sonic staging inside the metro becomes just an important factor in one’s journey.

						R. Murray Chafer’s idea of acoustic ecology aims to dissect such environments through sonic
						means. The metro in this sense is the extreme of such a radical acoustic environment as all its
						sonic elements are confined to the boundaries of man-made enclosed spaces.
					</p>
					<div class="side"></div>

						In the case of Line 3, announcements, warning sounds, and trains approaching, all define an
						unnatural space through sound, in which the individual often falls silent.
						<br><br>
						Other than constituting an already overwhelming ambiance of buzzing lamps, loud trains, monotone
						escalators and slamming doors, the metro requires the passengers to also pay attention to the
						vocal instructions of the system. On the old line, power commanded the passenger from rusty
						loudspeakers, as a faceless human voice, repeated pieces of information regarding where we are
						and where we are going. It alarms us of the dangers of the platform edge or the closing doors
						and does not forget to remind us to present our tickets to the inspectors.

						“Kérem vigyázzanak, az ajtók záródnak!”
						(Please be careful, the doors are closing!)
						<br><br>
						2. After that came the announcement of the upcoming station, along with additional information
						if needed, such as the sides on which the doors will open, or transfer options:
						“A Népliget következik. Az ajtók a jobb oldalon nyílnak.
						Átszállhatnak a távolsági és helyközi autóbuszokra.”
						(The following station is Népliget — People’s Park. Doors will open on the right.
						You can transfer here to national and regional buses.
						<br><br>
						3. At the time of the arrival to the station, the name will then be repeated once more as to
						state that one has indeed arrived.

						These vocal frameworks, however, often got sabotaged by their surrounding sonic conditions. On
						many of the footage that I came to find, the voices of the announcers, fade into the loudness of
						machines that surround them.

						The sonic staging of the metro in general acquires an inescapable space of sonic conditions,

						As the metropolis leaves less and less space for natural sound environments, metros can provide
						us with a speculative reading regarding the dominance of structured sounds in our everyday

						As we get off, the doors close and the train speeds off onto the next station. We leave the
						perron and emerge from the depths of the metro back onto the street, fulfilling the function of
						this system. Our travel was a success, as we have reached a destination, in an efficient manner.
						We probably will not be late to our workplace, school, exhibition or meeting.
						<br><br>
						As we pass shady figures in the underpass, the smell of piss slowly replaces the electrical
						scent of the tracks. As we approach the stairs to the street, cold wind blows in our face. We
						are close to being back in the “natural world”. Leaving the underground behind and getting freed
						of the rules and limits of this environment.

						As the renovation of Line 3 of Budapest remains a fresh contribution to the Budapest
						infrastructure, the integrity of these spaces will remain a question for the future. However,
						since metros remain relevant factors within a city’s ecosystem, my investigation of the
						renovation process aimed at compiling the notions behind the renovation of such an environment.
						Having presented various functions inside of Line 3, I hereby wish to devote my findings as a
						guide for all, to help understand how the transformation of these spaces will both inherit and
						reject their past functions.
