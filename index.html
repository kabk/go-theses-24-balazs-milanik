					I was around 3 years old in 2004, when my parents finally decided that I was old enough to bring me
					along to the capital of Hungary, Budapest. Other than falling heads first into a fountain in the
					Buda castle, the most memorable moments of my visit came from the discovery of the metro under the
					city. I was amazed by this intricate, yet robust underground system and all of its audio-visual
					aspects: the colourful and grandiose interiors of the stations, the smell of electricity, the sounds
					of announcements and loud rumbling of the rolling stocks made, or the seemingly never-ending
					escalators that connected these cut-off spaces with the surface above.<br />

					Since some 19 years after my first encounters with this mode of transportation not only did I grew
					older, but so did the environment that I have discovered at the time. The Budapest metro has gone
					through a tumultuous and constant development of constructions and reconstructions that originally
					started way back in 1896 with the opening of continental Europe&rsquo;s first metro line and as of
					right now ended with the latest construction works being finished in 2023.<br /> <br /> Having
					started to study in the field of graphic design, I firmly believe that our craft has a lot to do
					with how these environments are conveyed. Metros constitute a part in a city which is fully designed
					from the length of the tracks all the way to the typefaces used on signage. It is a product of human
					origin. <br /> <br /> Thus, I would like to focus on the exploration of metro line three, which
					other than being the busiest and longest line of the city also has gone through a recent renovation
					process that was aimed at refurbishing the most run-down line in the city. <br /> <br />&nbsp;

			<h1><br>Of Metro Line Three In Brief</h1>

					The észak–déli metróvonal (north-south metro line) commonly referred to as the kék metró (blue
					metro) is the longest and busiest line in the Budapest public transport system. Counting 20 stations
					on a 16,5km long spread on the Pest (east) side of the city, the line serves as a connection between
					commercial industrial and residential areas, while also accessing important public points such as
					hospitals, bus terminals, train stations, or other metro lines. With a daily ridership of 500000, it
					has become an organic part of the Budapest metropolitan area.<br />
					<br />
					It was initially planned and built in the socialist era between 1970–1990 that played an important
					role in its audio-visual conditions. In my opinion, contemporary designers’ architects, and planners
					have envisioned often experimental, and in some cases straight-up artistic graphical plans for the
					stations, cars, signs, and sounds, informed by the taste of the time elements of the 70s and 80s.

					Despite my personal taste in funky socialist designs, that I might also appreciate more since I
					never had to use the system daily, in the eyes of passengers the metro was rather a grim environment
					of another time. If one had taken line three in the past decades on a regular basis, their
					experiences mostly have consisted of listening to the loud rumbling of old Soviet trains that sped
					in-between dirty and poorly lit stations of old-fashioned ran-down designs, commanded by melancholic
					announcements, checked and supervised by shady inspectors, led by confusing signage, all this below
					the ground.<br />

					While the line overall remained operational, over the years it seemed like that time had stopped
					under the ground, while on the surface it sped away, leaving the spaces as hidden stains on the
					capitals ever evolving image. As decades passed, many layers of junk have started to stack up both
					in the visual and functional sense. In simple terms: the metro became outdated.<br />
					The steady deterioration of the line was due to the lack of financial and systemic maintenance.
					Almost all elements from signage and ornaments to the metro cars and tracks were basically left to
					rot to an extent that by the end of 2010s, even the safety of passengers using the metro in general
					became a realistic concern.
					After a recent and long needed renovation of line three beginning on the 4<sup>th</sup> of November,
					2017, and the complete change of the metro cars in early 2018, line three is now just as new as it
					was in it’s initial opening.<br />
					<br />
					As the ideas of rapid movement that emerge both as a need and a result of Western metropolitan life
					constitute a need the overarches socialist and capitalist ideologies, the way in which the metro
					functions remains unchanged. In this sense the line has received more of a makeover, rather than a
					new purpose/function, which as we will see, creates an interesting scale on which the spaces of line
					three either feel completely new while in others the differences between the new and old lines are
					quite hard to spot.With that, I would like to commence our travel with our descent to the first
					stage: the underpass.<br />
